#     Data Analysis in Python

## Goal

This repository offers several Python scripts to perform sales data analysis in a fictional store scenario. Scripts demonstrate how to perform various manipulation, aggregation, sorting, and merging operations of data using the Pandas libraries.

## Use

1. Clone this repository on your local machine using the command:
   
     ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/SEU_NOME_DE_USUARIO/SEU_NOME_DO_REPOSITORIO.git
    ```

3. Execution of the Scripts:

    * Go to the folder arquivos_fontewithin the cloned repository.
    * Use a code editor or the Jupyter Notebook to open and run the Python scripts.
    * Each script contains instructions and examples of use to perform different data analysis.

4. **Threads em Java**: Utilize threads para implementar a l√≥gica do sistema.

    * Jupyter Notebook is an ideal tool for running and viewing Python scripts interactively.
    1. Install the Jupyter Notebook: 
        ```shell
        git clone https://github.com/SEU_NOME_DE_USUARIO/SEU_NOME_DO_REPOSITORIO.git
        ```
    2. Navigate to the folder arquivos_fontein the terminal.
    3. Run the following command to start the Jupyter Notebook: 
        ```shell
        jupyter notebook
        ```
    4. Select the Python script you want to run in the Jupyter Notebook interface.
    5. Run the script by pressing the "Run" button or using keyboard shortcuts.
    6. The analyses will be performed and the results will be displayed in the Jupyter Notebook interface.
    7. Make sure you have Python 3.x and the Pandas library installed on your machine.
    8. You can adapt the scripts to analyze your own data sets.
